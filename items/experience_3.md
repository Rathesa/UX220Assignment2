<h2>Starting University</h2>
<body>
<p> In 2015, I began my studies at Wilfrid Laurier University. Honours Chemistry was my major. It was an incredible opportunity for me to gain independence while attending class and meeting new people. Attending labs, where I got to do some hands-on learning, was my favorite memory. These labs make the chemistry program more enjoyable! Exams, on the other hand, I did not enjoy because they were quite stressful. Overall, I gave this experience a B because it was incredibly enjoyable and taught me a lot about life.
