<h2> Getting my First Job After finishing University (the first time) </h2>
<body>
<p>  
After graduating from university, my first job in relation to my Major was an Analyst assistant. I worked for an Environmental lab in Waterloo. I was a good experience as I was applying my school knowledge in the workforce. Being able to apply my school knowledge at work made it fill fulling. My favourite memory was using all the cool equipment to analyze samples, it was interesting to see how these machines work and how useful they are. One thing I didn’t enjoy was that sometimes the samples were very smelly it was not fun to work on them. I’d give this experience a B.
