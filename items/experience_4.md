<h2> Getting my Driver License</h2>
<body>
<p>In 2018, I received my full G driver's license. Overall, the experience was enjoyable, however, the transition from G1 to G2 and finally G was lengthy.  My favorite memory is when I passed my test. It was a wonderful feeling to pass. Driving school was the portion I didn't enjoy. It was incredibly expensive, but it was well worth it. I would grade this experience C, it was okay.
