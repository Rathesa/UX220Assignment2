<h2>Moving to Waterloo</h2>
<body>
<p> I moved for Brampton to Waterloo in 2015. Moving was a pain, and packing your belongings into boxes required a lot of effort. I was both excited and scared about the move. Leaving the place where I grew up was difficult, but starting something new in a different city was really thrilling. Going to a new school and living on my own made the move worthwhile. My favorite memory was rekindling an old friend from elementary school.  What I didn't enjoy was leaving home and the moving process. If only there was an easy method to go about.  I would give this experience a C, it was okay experience. </p>
